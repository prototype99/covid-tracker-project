This file is inside a [repository](repository.md). To make changes to a [repository](repository.md), you don't. Instead, you [fork](fork.md) the [repository](repository.md). [Commit](commit.md) the changes to your [fork](fork.md) and make a [pull request](pull-request.md), make sure to check the [repository](repository.md) now and then, and you should soon see your changes [merged](merge.md) into it. You can just work on a git repository in your browser, but that is not particularly recommended, please consider using a [git client](git-client.md).
