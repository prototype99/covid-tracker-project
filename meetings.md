There is a new major meeting every thursday (where a venue is available for physical presence), and a new minor meeting whenever required. The numbering for minor meetings resets every major meeting, at which point the number of each of the minor meetings that occurred during that time is also finalised.

During the easter break there may not be any major meetings, this will have to be decided at a later date. When the minor meeting would be 0, it is omitted.

It is generally expected for all members to be there for major meetings with a preference to physical presence but no real need for it either; minor meetings are impromptu and as is the nature, members are not expected to be there. It is ill-advised for minor meetings to be physical due to current circumstances.
