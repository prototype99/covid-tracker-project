## 1. Introduction

The unit is assessed 100% based upon one piece of coursework, with two components, weighted at
100% of the unit marks.

In summary, you will be required to complete a group project suitable for your chosen degree
programme in a small team. You will be assessed first and foremost on your individual contribution to
the project through a written reflection, examining your skills in project management, independent
learning, and critical self-reflection, and secondly on your group’s project outcome demonstrated
through a showcase video.

## 2. Aim

With Professional Development, we will give you the opportunity to start to feel like a professional.
The **Professional Project** is your first step into that world, and we try to emulate as much of the
professional world as possible through this assessment.

We hope that you appreciate that some elements of the ‘real world’ are quite easy to emulate, and
some much trickier, but every aspect of this assessment has been designed with this in mind. For
example, you will complete your projects in groups, to simulate the sort of difficulties you might
expect to encounter when team working with others in the workplace.

We sincerely hope that you will find yourself working on a project that you are genuinely interested
in, and which you are committed to, and which you can use as an example of a large piece of work
you have contributed to, when applying for placements, or graduate opportunities, in the future.

To be successful in the Professional Project, you will particularly need the following skills:

- **Project Planning** : From the word go, you will be required to think about what it is you need
    to do, and how long you have to do it. You will be answering questions such as: ‘How much
    work can we complete in a set period of time?’ and reactively responding when you find out
    that you can’t complete as much work as you think. All of this will contribute to the
    development of your project planning skills, crucial not only to your final year projects, but
    also in the wider scope of your time management.
- **Problem Solving** : Each of the Professional Projects will push you to the edge, or beyond, your
    comfort zone in terms of your technical skills and abilities. You will need to learn things beyond
    your first-year units, and which may be different to what you have been learning in your
    second-year units. You will need to find ways to complete work that may be held up by
    someone else, and all of this will contribute to your ability to solve real-world problems as
    they present themselves.
- **Team Working and Communication** : Working as a team of four or five students gives you the
    opportunity to demonstrate your ability to work with others, as well as individually in your
    other units. You will need to communicate clearly amongst yourselves, with your tutor, and in
    the various assessed elements. You will need to manage your team effectively – ensuring that
    you all work to the best of your abilities – and this is no mean feat.


## 3. Assessment Overview ( 1 CWK 100 )

To complete this assessment, you are required to undertake a professional project in a small team of
four to five students. The exact nature of your project will vary depending on your specific brief, but
generally will involve the development of **a product** of some kind (e.g. a prototype piece of software,
a digital artefact such as a game or animation, or an event or activity that you are required to organise).
You will **also** need to produce **a technical report** that would allow for the continued development of
your project (i.e. a handover report).

You are required to engage with **two** submission points for the professional project, specifically:

```
Element Description Mark Weighting
Showcase
Video and
Technical
Report
```
```
You must showcase the outcomes of your project, in
the format of a video showcase and a technical report,
submitted at the end of Block 4, Week 6 ( 30 th April
2021).
```
Group (^) **25 %
Reflection**
You are required to **reflect** upon your own, individual
contribution to your group’s project, in a brief written
reflection. This element is the final submission for the
professional project.
Individual (^) **75 %**
Although we will help and guide you through the process of your project, **you** are required to take
ownership of your project, and this may require you to arrange and schedule meetings with your
group, to develop your own week-by-week project plan, and to make critical decisions about how your
project will progress. Your tutor will support you through the project process, **but** , is not in the role
of technical consultant, and is not expected to provide technical support with your team’s specific
project.
Your professional project is a major undertaking, contributing 100 % of the weighting to your
Professional Development mark. As 100 % of a 30-credit unit, we anticipate each member of your
team should aim to spend **_approximately_** **300 hours** working towards your project. This includes
attending your timetabled sessions, engaging in project meetings and planning your project, as well
as contributing towards the development of your product and report.

### Project Allocation

At the start of the unit’s block, each course on the Computing & Digital Technology Network will be
presented with a list of eligible project topics. These project topics have been carefully chosen to
match the skills and abilities of a potential graduate in that field of study.

Students will be required to engage with a **Project Preferences Process** to establish which of the
projects they will be undertaking for the duration of the unit. This process will ask students to ‘rank’
a number of favourable projects, produce a short, written statement, and will require the upload of a
CV that illustrates the students’ skills, abilities and interests. **Submission closes on 5 th March 2021**.

The Professional Development teaching team will then use the students’ expressed preferences to
form teams, considering written statements and CVs, to help ensure that teams contain a mixture of
students with different backgrounds, and skillsets, and allocate these teams to projects.

**Failure to submit to the Project Preferences Process will mean that you are unable to express your
preferences, and you will be allocated to a default team.**


## 4. The Showcase Video and Technical Report (25%)

Although each project is unique in nature, it is anticipated that each project will have roughly two foci.
Principally, you will be working on a **product** – this is typically a digital artefact, for example, a website,
a software solution, a computer game, animation or video – and a **technical report**. It is **your team’s
responsibility** to identify the requirements of these two things based on your project’s brief.

Each team is required to demonstrate the deliverables of their project through a **video showcase** and
**technical report** uploaded to Moodle by **30 th April 2021**. Only one person from each team needs to
upload the showcase video and technical report.

### The Showcase Video

The Showcase Video gives your team the opportunity to demonstrate your product in action, and
show us the technical skills that you have developed.

Showcase videos should be **ten to fifteen minutes long** and can be presented by either one member
of the team, or a mix of members of the team (e.g. through several different video clips edited
together). You **will not** be assessed on the quality of your video recording or editing.

Your showcase video should briefly tour your product, demonstrating all the features that you have
implemented, with a short discussion of how (and why) these features were implemented. You should
also include details of who on the team was responsible for each of the features.

Videos can be captured using any software you see fit, though it is recommended that you use open-
source screen capture software, such as OBS (https://obsproject.com/).

### The Technical Report

You will need to identify the **requirements** of your product through a process of **requirements analysis**
and **design** , and you will need to document this process via your **technical report**.

While your technical report will vary in nature depending on the type of project you are doing,
generally it should aim to answer the following questions:

- What were the **requirements** of your project?
- What **design** did you do to address those requirements?
- What did you make in your project? (i.e. what is the product)
- How do you **use** the product?
- What would a team looking to ‘pick up’ your project and continue it need to know to continue
    development?


A possible structure for your report might be:

1. Title Page
2. Abstract
3. Contents Page
4. Introduction
5. Requirements
6. Design
7. Implementation
8. User Guide
9. Handover Report
10. Conclusions
11. References
12. Appendices

It is recommended that you discuss your plans for both your product **and** your report with your unit
tutor early, so that they can make suggestions as to whether you are meeting the objectives of your

### project.

### How will The Showcase Video and Technical Report be marked?

The showcase video and technical report will be marked using the following two, equally weighted,
criteria:

```

development of the project**.


## 5. The Reflection ( 75 %)

Each student is required to complete an **individual** reflection on the process of completing their
professional project. This reflection encourages you to think about what **your** contribution to your
group’s success (or otherwise) has been. The intention of the reflection is for you to **be honest**. We
are not looking for you to declare that you were the most important member of the team who
contributed the most time, effort and/or knowledge. We are looking for you to honestly reflect on
the work you have contributed, think about what you have learnt, and how you might use the
professional development that has taken place during your project in the future.

The reflection will be guided through a template (provided on Moodle), which will encourage you to
think about how you have contributed – and how you can evidence this contribution – in several areas
related to your professional development.

Upon completion of your reflection, you will be asked to provide a self-evaluated mark for your
individual performance in the professional project. **Your tutor, based on the evidence you have
provided throughout the year, will then have to agree this mark**. Your tutor can raise or lower the
mark you have chosen, based on the provided evidence, and whether, based on their experience of
working with you through the year, they feel you have appropriately contributed to your team’s
professional project.

## WARNING : All students must complete the reflection element of this

## assessment. Failure to submit the reflection, or submitting the

## reflection late, will incur the appropriate penalty for the entire

## 1CWK100: Professional Project assessment, regardless of your

## engagement with any other elements. For details of the penalties for

## non-submission, or late submission, please see the university’s

## Assessment Regulations.

## Please ensure that you prepare your Reflection with sufficient time and

## ensure that you upload your work to Moodle in advance of the 9pm

## deadline.

Marks awarded for the reflection element are **individual marks**. The work of your team, or any other
student, has no impact on the mark you are given for your reflection.

The outcome of your project, whether successful or otherwise, has no bearing on your reflection. **It is
entirely possible to produce an excellent project, but achieve a failing grade in the reflection, and
vice-versa.**


## 6. Help and Support

### Help! I don’t know where to begin or what to do!

Don’t panic!

You are not alone in completing your professional project, and your team members – and your tutor

- are with you throughout the year. The very first step is to ensure that you know (a) who your team
members are, and (b) what your project brief is. As long as you know at least these two things, you
can’t go too far wrong! If you don’t, arrange to speak to your tutor as a matter of urgency.

It’s important to ensure that you **plan** your project carefully, and that you **amend this plan** as you
work on the project. You may find that you don’t get as much work done as you think – or that you
actually get much more done – and as a team, you should update your plan to reflect this. **Being
organised will help you far more than anything else.**

You should also ensure that, as far as possible, you stay together as a team throughout the block.
Having a strong bond and keeping strong communication links, through the year will help you through
the project. We’d recommend that you engage in **some sort of bonding activity** at the start of the
year (this might be something social – try an online virtual quiz, or play some online games together)
to get to know each other better. Make sure that you have each other’s contact details (that you’re
willing to share – this might only be through Teams for example) and that you’ve agreed how, and
when, you can get hold of each other.

Your project **will** take you outside of your comfort zone. You **will** need to learn new skills to complete
the project. It might be tough at times, but everything you do will ultimately make you feel stronger,
and more able to tackle the other problems you face as you complete your degree, ready to go into
the world of work.

### I have a problem with my team, or a member of my team, what should I do?

We recognise that there can always be problems that arise where group work is involved, and we will
aim to minimise difficulties where possible. Please remember that a significant weighting of the
assessment is down to **your individual contribution** , and that your other team members **cannot affect
this in any way**.

That being said, we know that in extremely rare circumstances, teams may have significant difficulties.
If you’re ever uncomfortable, or someone in your team is behaving in a way that is unacceptable,
please contact your lab tutor **as soon as possible** explaining the situation as thoroughly as you can.
We will **never** tolerate student behaviour that is outside of the Student Code of Conduct^1.

### Opportunities for Formative Feedback

Formative feedback for the professional project is ongoing throughout the block. Your tutor is also
your main contact for support for the project, **although their role is to provide guidance on the shape
and direction of the project, not technical help.**

In each week, you will report to your tutor to discuss progress, and your tutor will offer verbal feedback
on the progress you have made so far. This feedback should encourage you to think about how you
can further the development of your project, and to think about the areas that need the most
development at that point in time.

(^1) https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/student-case-management/guidance-for-students/student-code-of-conduct/


### When, where and how can I get support from the unit tutors?

Your mid-week sessions are the main conduit for support, and formative feedback, from your tutor.
Many of the sessions will be dedicated to a progress update and check-in with your tutor over your
project, and your progress so far. You should arrive to each session ready to discuss your progress.
We also recommend that you use this time to arrange a team meeting, and reflect on your progress
from the previous week, and plan your work for the upcoming week.

If you need to contact your tutor directly, please use the contact details provided in the Unit
Handbook. If you have greater concerns, or are in a real panic, please contact the Professional
Development unit leader, with the following contact details:
