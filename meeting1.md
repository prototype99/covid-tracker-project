This meeting will be used to check progress and verify team roles, in particular [lead tester](lead-tester.md).

This meeting will include a check to make sure that everyone is comfortable with [git](git.md) as there has been issues.

This meeting will hopefully instigate the beginning of code production and will also include a [lead writer](lead-writer.md) consultation.
